        <h1>My Story</h1>
                <h3>I grew up hunting and fishing the mountains and plains of central Montana.  The skills I acquired as a teenager lead me down a path into the Army. I spent 7 years as an Infantrymen including 2.5 years in Iraq.  I left the army to work the oilfields and traveled all over the country for the next 13 years.  I found myself back in Montana and have decided to combine all of my hobbies into a new career path.  I am currently a student at the University of Montana study art and photography.  I want to become an outdoor and wildlife photography and spend the rest of my life doing the things I enjoy.</h3>
